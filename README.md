# WPF Diet Application

A WPF application for tracking and planning nutrition. I am writing this because I would like to use it! The idea is that you will enter some user information and the program will automatically calculate how many calories and macronutrients you should eat. You can also keep a database of food nutrition info and use it to plan meals to meet your goals.

This will be a Windows desktop application using WPF for the UI and EntityFrameworkCore for the database.
